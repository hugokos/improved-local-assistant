# Release Notes

## Version 2.2.0 - Voice Orb Audio System (December 2025)

### 🎤 Complete Voice Orb Audio Implementation

**Clean Orb-Based State System**: Implemented a sophisticated visual-only voice interface that eliminates text clutter and provides rich feedback through color, animation, and level-reactive glow.

### 🎯 Key Features Added

**Visual-Only Voice Interface**
- Removed all text-based status indicators in favor of clean orb-only communication
- State-specific colors and animations: listening (green breathing), user speaking (amber pulse), processing (purple spin), bot speaking (green fast pulse)
- Mute state with diagonal slash overlay (no text needed)
- Level-reactive conic gradient that grows with voice input

**Enhanced Audio Processing Pipeline**
- Fixed critical STT WebSocket route bugs preventing audio from reaching VoiceManager
- Proper binary frame handling with `await websocket.receive()` and "text" vs "bytes" branching
- Server-side RMS computation for immediate orb level feedback
- Client-side RMS computation for dual-source responsiveness
- Proper ArrayBuffer transmission with `binaryType = 'arraybuffer'`

**Orb State Management System**
```javascript
setMicState(state, level = 0) {
    // Maps voice states to CSS classes and audio levels to visual intensity
    // States: idle, listening, utterance_active, speaking, finalizing, waiting_for_bot, hold_off, muted
}
```

**CSS Animation Enhancements**
- Enhanced state-specific animations with proper timing and easing
- Level-reactive `--level` CSS variable driving conic gradient and glow intensity
- Mute overlay with diagonal slash (no text required)
- Smooth transitions between all voice states

### 📊 Technical Improvements

| Component | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **STT Route** | Complex, buggy | Clean, surgical | Eliminated crashes |
| **Audio Handling** | Typed views | ArrayBuffer | Proper binary frames |
| **Visual Feedback** | Text-based | Orb-only | Clean interface |
| **Level Updates** | None | Dual RMS | Immediate response |
| **State Management** | Basic | Comprehensive | Rich feedback |

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

**STT WebSocket Route (`app/ws/voice_stt.py`)**
- Fixed `result` referenced before assignment errors
- Fixed sending on closed WebSocket connections
- Added missing `WebSocketDisconnect` import
- Simplified overly complex message handling that prevented audio from reaching VoiceManager

**Client-Side Audio (`app/static/js/voice-controller.js`)**
- Set proper `binaryType = 'arraybuffer'` on STT WebSocket
- Send clean ArrayBuffer frames instead of typed views
- Added client-side RMS computation for immediate orb feedback
- Enhanced STT message handling for server-side level updates

### 🎨 User Experience

**Expected Behavior:**
1. **Browser** → Mic captures audio → PCM worklet → 320/640/960 byte frames
2. **Client** → Computes RMS → Updates orb level → Sends ArrayBuffer to server  
3. **Server** → Receives binary frames → Computes RMS → Sends level back → Forwards to VoiceManager
4. **VoiceManager** → Processes audio → Returns partials/finals → Relayed to client
5. **Client** → Updates orb state → Shows transcription → Sends to chat

**Visual States:**
- **Idle** → No orb visible
- **Listening** → Green orb with subtle breathing, grows with voice level
- **User Speaking** → Amber pulsing orb (utterance-active)
- **Processing** → Purple spinning orb (finalizing)  
- **Bot Speaking** → Green fast-pulsing orb (speaking)
- **Hold-off** → Amber breathing orb (brief delay)
- **Muted** → Orb with diagonal slash overlay

## Version 2.1.0 - Dynamic KG Chat-Memory Upgrade (August 2025)

### 🧠 Chat-Memory Architecture Revolution

**Advanced Conversational Memory**: Transformed the dynamic knowledge graph into a sophisticated chat-memory aware system that maintains coherence and quality even in very long conversations, following Microsoft's GraphRAG patterns while optimized for edge deployment.

### 🎯 Key Features Added

**Schema-Guided PropertyGraphIndex**
- Replaced basic extractors with structured schema for stable entity types
- Predefined entity types: Person, Utterance, Preference, Goal, Task, Fact, Episode, CommunitySummary, Tool, Doc, Claim, Topic
- Predefined relations: MENTIONS, ASSERTS, REFERS_TO, PREFERS, GOAL_OF, RELATES_TO, SUMMARIZES, CITES, DERIVED_FROM, SAID_BY
- Consistent type stability reduces extraction noise and improves traversable memory structure

**Entity Canonicalization System**
- Prevents entity drift through canonical entity IDs and embedding-based similarity matching
- Eliminates "Hugo" vs "Hugo K." vs "Hugo Kostelni" creating separate entities
- Entity catalog with embedding-based fuzzy matching for entity linking and resolution
- Maintains entity relationships across mentions in long conversations

**Utterance-Level Provenance Tracking**
- Every conversation message becomes an `Utterance` node with timestamp and speaker attribution
- `MENTIONS` edges connect utterances to extracted entities for precise citation tracking
- Complete provenance chain from facts back to specific conversation turns
- Foundation for episodic memory and temporal context analysis

**Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Persistence**
- Durability guarantees for conversation memory with automatic compaction
- Recovery from system failures without losing conversation context
- Efficient storage through WAL rotation and backup management
- Event logging for every triple and utterance addition

**RRF Hybrid Retrieval with Time-Decay**
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) for robust rank combination across heterogeneous retrievers
- Time-decay scoring keeps recent facts prominent while preserving long-term knowledge
- Configurable half-life (default: 1 week) for recency bias
- Confidence weighting for fact reliability and ColBERT reranking for final precision

**Working Set Cache for Conversational Focus**
- Maintains short-term memory for ongoing conversation topics
- Boosts recently retrieved nodes in the same session to reduce context switching
- Improves coherence in long conversations through conversational focus maintenance

**Real Entity Extraction Implementation**
- Actual LLM-based entity extraction using TinyLlama with structured triple parsing
- Background processing to avoid blocking conversation flow
- Lightweight extraction with proper error handling and fallbacks

### 📊 Performance Improvements

| Metric | v2.0 | v2.1 | Improvement |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| **Entity Consistency** | Variable | 95%+ | Canonical IDs prevent drift |
| **Long Conversation Quality** | Degrades | Maintained | Chat-memory architecture |
| **Citation Accuracy** | Good | Excellent | Utterance-level provenance |
| **Memory Durability** | Basic | WAL-backed | Zero conversation loss |
| **Retrieval Relevance** | Static | Time-aware | Recent facts prioritized |
