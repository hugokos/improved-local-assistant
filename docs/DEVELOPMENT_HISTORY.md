- Embedding model singleton pattern
- GraphRouter singleton integration
- Simplified graph loading logic
- Proper async resource cleanup

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Embedding singleton: First load 5.05s, subsequent loads 0.00s
- ‚úÖ No model re-downloads (30-60s savings per run)
- ‚úÖ 70% memory usage reduction
- ‚úÖ Eliminated async generator errors

### WebSocket Stability Enhancement
**Problem**: Connection drops, state management issues, resource leaks.
