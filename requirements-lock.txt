# This file is auto-generated by pip-tools with Python 3.12
# To update, run:
#
#    pip-compile --generate-hashes pyproject.toml
#
# This file provides exact versions for reproducible builds.
# Use: pip install -r requirements-lock.txt

# Note: Run `pip-tools pip-compile pyproject.toml` to generate this file
# For now, this is a placeholder. In production, you would run:
# pip install pip-tools
# pip-compile --generate-hashes pyproject.toml --output-file requirements-lock.txt

# The actual lock file would contain exact versions with hashes like:
# fastapi==0.110.0 \
#     --hash=sha256:abc123...
# uvicorn[standard]==0.27.0 \
#     --hash=sha256:def456...

# For development, use: pip install -e .[dev]
# For production, use: pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
