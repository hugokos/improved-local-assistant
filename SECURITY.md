## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Improved Local AI Assistant, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@example.com**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What an attacker could achieve by exploiting this vulnerability
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, and relevant dependencies
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will not take legal action against researchers who report vulnerabilities in good faith
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying the Improved Local AI Assistant:

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version with security patches
2. **Network Security**: Deploy behind a firewall and use HTTPS in production
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Data Protection**: Ensure sensitive data is properly encrypted at rest and in transit
5. **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for suspicious activities

### For Developers

When contributing to the project:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
4. **Code Review**: All security-related changes require thorough review
5. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for different features
- **API Security**: Token-based authentication for API endpoints

## Known Security Considerations

### Local Model Security
- **Model Integrity**: Verify model checksums when downloading from external sources
- **Model Isolation**: Models run in isolated processes to limit potential impact
- **Resource Limits**: Built-in resource monitoring prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### Knowledge Graph Security
- **Data Sanitization**: All extracted entities and relationships are sanitized
- **Access Control**: Knowledge graphs are isolated per user/session
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with secure key management

### Voice Interface Security
- **Local Processing**: All voice processing happens locally with no cloud dependencies
- **Audio Privacy**: Audio data is processed in memory and not stored permanently
- **Command Validation**: Voice commands are validated before execution

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

When we receive a security report:

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent to reporter
3. **Day 3-7**: Initial assessment and severity classification
4. **Day 8-30**: Investigation, fix development, and testing
5. **Day 31+**: Coordinated disclosure and patch release
